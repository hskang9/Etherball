# Etherball
lottery on ethereum blockchain platform


# Rule

1. The Contract creator sets the time for the end of a lottery and the number to win is set from him since Ethereum's system is deterministic and does not support random number.
2. Players participate the game by guesssing the number of a lottery(Owner cannot join this game because he sets it up).
3. At the end of the lottery, If there is no winner, owner gets all of the ether sent to the contract. If player guess the number, player takes 90% of ether in the contract. The creator takes 10% for setting up another game.
